# A Mask is a 2D matrix (8-bit pixel values), an image whose pixels are either
# 255 (all bits are 1) or 0 (all bits are 0) where non-zero elements indicate
# the pixels that belong to the mask (the pixel with value 255 are said to be
# "included" in the mask, while the others are "excluded" or out of the mask).
#
# When a Mask is created from another image, it means that the mask has the
# same height and width as the other image.
# Masks are typically used to identify or mark regions of an image. And since
# the pixel values are all 1's or 0's, it is easy to operate them using logical
# (bitwise) operations.
